/**
 * GER Ruleset Rules are a set of conditions defined within a Global Event Ruleset. These rules have expressions, whose evaluation will determine the destination service for the incoming events.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as squadcast from "@irisdanded/pulumi-squadcast";
 * import * as squadcast from "@pulumi/squadcast";
 *
 * const exampleTeam = squadcast.getTeam({
 *     name: "Example Team",
 * });
 * const exampleUser = squadcast.getUser({
 *     email: "john@example.com",
 * });
 * const exampleService = exampleTeam.then(exampleTeam => squadcast.getService({
 *     name: "Example Service",
 *     teamId: exampleTeam.id,
 * }));
 * const exampleGer = new squadcast.Ger("exampleGer", {
 *     description: "Example GER Description",
 *     teamId: exampleTeam.then(exampleTeam => exampleTeam.id),
 *     entityOwner: {
 *         id: exampleUser.then(exampleUser => exampleUser.id),
 *         type: "user",
 *     },
 * });
 * const exampleGerRuleset = new squadcast.ger.Ruleset("exampleGerRuleset", {
 *     gerId: exampleGer.id,
 *     alertSource: "Prometheus",
 *     catchAllAction: {
 *         route_to: exampleService.then(exampleService => exampleService.id),
 *     },
 * });
 * const exampleGerRulesetRule = new squadcast.ger.ruleset.Rule("exampleGerRulesetRule", {
 *     gerId: exampleGer.id,
 *     alertSource: exampleGerRuleset.alertSource,
 *     expression: "alertname == \"DeploymentReplicasNotUpdated\"",
 *     description: "Example GER Ruleset Rule",
 *     action: {
 *         route_to: exampleService.then(exampleService => exampleService.id),
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * gerID:alertSourceName:ruleID
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import squadcast:ger/ruleset/rule:Rule ger_ruleset_rule_import "50:Grafana:100"
 * ```
